Bees are very important agents for the maintenance of our nature and they pollinate 80% of all flowering plants in the world. \n \n Currently they are in great danger due to the excessive use of pesticides, which cause them to lose their nests and in many cases end up dying. In the United States, it is estimated that in the past half century there was a loss of 50% of the bee population due to the use of pesticides. \n\nIn other words, bees are very valuable for the maintenance of life on Earth and it seems that they are not valued enough.
