This means that the apple and chocolate we eat and the cotton t-shirt we wear depend directly on the life of the bees. \n \n Currently they are in great danger due to the excessive use of pesticides, which cause them to lose their nests and in many cases end up dying. Pesticides affect the navigation system of bees and cause them to get lost from their hives. This phenomenon is called CCD (Colony Collapse Disorder), which has been studied in the recent years by scientists. In the United States, it is estimated that in the past half century there was a loss of 50% of the bee population due to the use of fipronil and neonicotinoids. \n\nIn other words, bees are very valuable for the maintenance of life on Earth and it seems that they are not valued enough.
